# csvcubed

csvcubed project provides a command line tool which make it straightforward to turn a CSV into 5-star linked data (CSV-W)

By publishing 5-star linked data and leveraging open standards for data, we believe that we can help ensure that statistical data is discoverable, comparable and analysable by automated tools. We hope that this standards-based approach will unlock network effects which accelerate data analysis by making it easier to collate, compare and contrast data from different sources.

All our work depends on open standards; however it isn't just for open data. Share your data with the world or keep it private, the choice is yours.
