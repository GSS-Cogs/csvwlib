# Build with GitHub actions

The csv-to-csvw GitHub action enables you to build CSV-Ws by pushing CSV and qube-config.json files to a Git repository configured with GitHub Actions. It is designed to bring csvcubed to users who have difficulty installing software in corporate environments, or for those who want to keep a versioned history of their publications.
